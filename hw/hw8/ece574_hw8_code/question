How many device do we have? How do we name the device define by?

How do we know how many elements should be contained in the array?

When cudaMalloc(), is it getting the address of the device and allocate it with
the N?

How to get the grid/block/thread count right:
int blockId = blockIdx.y* gridDim.x+ blockIdx.x;
int i = blockId * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
