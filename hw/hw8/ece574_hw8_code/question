How many device do we have? How do we name the device define by?

How do we know how many elements should be contained in the array?

When cudaMalloc(), is it getting the address of the device and allocate it with
the N?

How to get the grid/block/thread count right:
int blockId = blockIdx.y* gridDim.x+ blockIdx.x;
int i = blockId * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

What does the cudaMalloc allocate?
Allocate vector. Size of an array?
If allocate the size of an array, so the host name can be the sobel_x.pixels
and the device name is dev_x, size would be the size of the array?
