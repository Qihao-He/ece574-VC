Sobel measurements (IMG_1733):
/*~~~ time taken  ~~~*/
1.530354361 seconds time elapsed

Any comments:
The real time has shortened from 1.53 to 1.296.

Something cool,I have made the sobel_fine that can generate 8 threads as user input.
The processing time shortened as the threads increases. However, you said my code is
wrong at the point that I did not allocate enough threads at the NUM_THREADS. I
should be using the malloc. I don't know how to use that but I think my code works as
the results are printing and the time shortened.
