lec13 MPI Custom Data Types
QUESTION: Can you just cast your data into integers and uncast on the other
side.

cast into integers and uncast on the other side.

lec13 MPI mpi_wtime.c
QUESTION
PAPI returns a long integer that is showing the time, but the mpi_wtime.c
returns the the floating point. Are they measuring in cycles? or in Wall clock

static and dynamic schedule
QUESTION: Why is the Dynamic not working as fast as the static schedule in the
test? If this intuitive theory would lead to the process of handling data time
consuming, why is the static and dynamic schedule in our HW showing the opposite
results.
Why is the thread zero runs all the rest because it is so fast? Isn't the
thread are sharing the processor evenly?
